# interfacelift_downloader
A simple python script for downloading wallpapers from [interfacelift.com](https://interfacelift.com/) matching your desktop resolution
## What it does do
* Downloads the entire range of interfacelift wallpapers matching your desktop resolution
* Downloads the files to a folder named after your desktop resolution
* Files that are already downloaded will not be downloaded again. Simply the downloader will move to the next.
* You can specify the starting page and the ending page (insert the same page number if you want a specific page (i.e. 
starting page 2 - ending page 2))
## What it does not do
* It does not resume failed downloads (you have to delete the failed file yourself and run the script again)
